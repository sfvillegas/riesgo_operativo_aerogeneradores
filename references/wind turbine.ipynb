    "Context\n",
    "In Wind Turbines, Scada Systems measure and save data's like wind speed, wind direction, generated power etc. for 10 minutes intervals. This file was taken from a wind turbine's scada system that is working and generating power in Turkey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content\n",
    "The data's in the file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Date/Time (for 10 minutes intervals)\n",
    "LV ActivePower (kW): The power generated by the turbine for that moment\n",
    "Wind Speed (m/s): The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine (the wind speed that turbine use for electricity generation)\n",
    "Theoretical_Power_Curve (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer\n",
    "Wind Direction (Â°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automaticly)"
